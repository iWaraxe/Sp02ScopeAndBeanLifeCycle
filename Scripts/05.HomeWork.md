# 5. Homework Assignment (5 minutes)

We are now at the final segment of today's session where I'll assign some homework tasks to help reinforce the concepts we've covered today. Let's get started.

### Homework Tasks

To help solidify your understanding of today's topics, I've prepared a set of homework tasks. These tasks will guide you through expanding the Library Management System we started in the previous homework. This will give you practical experience in defining and managing beans, their scopes, lifecycle methods, and using different dependency injection techniques.

### Library Management System Enhancement

The Library Management System will be enhanced with the following components:
- **UserService:** A service class that manages users.
- **NotificationService:** A service class that sends notifications.
- **DatabaseConnection:** A component that simulates a database connection and uses lifecycle methods.
- **LibraryController:** A REST controller to manage library operations.

## Task 1: Create a Spring Application Demonstrating Different Bean Scopes
1. **Enhance the Library Management System with Different Bean Scopes:**
    2. Define `UserService` as a singleton bean.
    3. Define `NotificationService` as a prototype bean.
    4. Demonstrate the behavior by requesting these beans multiple times and observing whether new instances are created.

## Task 2: Implement Lifecycle Methods Using `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy`
1. **Create a `DatabaseConnection` Bean with Lifecycle Methods:**
    2. Use `@PostConstruct` for initialization logic.
    3. Use `@PreDestroy` for cleanup logic.
    4. Ensure this bean is used in the `LibraryService`.

## Task 3: Create Beans Using Constructor-Based and Setter-Based DI
1. **Enhance `LibraryService` and `UserService` with Constructor and Setter Injection:**
    2. Use constructor injection to inject `DatabaseConnection` into `LibraryService`.
    3. Use setter injection to inject `NotificationService` into `UserService`.
 
## Task 4: Inject Collections (List, Set, Map) into Beans
1. **Create a `StatisticsService` to Inject Collections of Beans:**
    2. Inject a list of `LibraryService` and `UserService` beans.
    3. Inject a set of `NotificationService` beans.
    4. Inject a map of `DatabaseConnection` beans.

## Task 5: Use `@Value` to Inject Properties from a Properties File
1. **Create a Properties File and Inject Values into a `ConfigService`:**
    2. Create an `application.properties` file.
    3. Use `@Value` to inject these properties into the `ConfigService`.

## Submission

Please complete these tasks and submit your code via our GitHub classroom by the end of the week. This will give you hands-on experience with different Spring configurations and help you understand the benefits and use cases of each approach.
